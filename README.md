This is a tool that came out after some work from the guys at Splendia back in 2012, specially :
=====
Adri√† Cidre, https://github.com/adriacidre
Natxo Treig, https://github.com/natxetee
Christof Damian, https://github.com/christofdamian , who already released another tool based in that work.


USAGE:

    ./auto-merge 
    ./auto-merge \<GitHubUser\> \<GitHubPassword\> \<owner\> \<repo\>

  The first option will work if you have set all the required parameters in the config file, find it at Config/config.yaml .
  you can also run the tool in debug mode:

    ./auto-merge --debug
